# Return 0 (true) if the virtual environment has been successfully created,
# activated, and all seed packages are successfully installed in the new
# virtual environment.
# Return a non-zero value (false) in a deactivated state otherwise.
#
# The "seed" packages pip, setuptools, and wheel are automatically installed
# into the virtual environment. All packages must be successfully installed for
# venvcreate to be considered a success.

# If a file or directory exists at the given path to the virtual environment,
# they may be deleted as part of virtual environment creation.
