# perfcomp

**perfcomp** is a performance analyzer on a PR commit basis.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install the latest version:

```bash
go install github.com/mongodb-labs/drivers-evergreen-tools/perfcomp
```

Or build it locally in `bin/perfcomp`:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

## ðŸ”§ Usage

To use `perfcomp`, you should have an analytics node URI env variable called `PERF_URI_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT`. You can request for it from the devprod performance team.

To run in your project repository, you need to create a [performance context](https://performance-monitoring-and-analysis.server-tig.prod.corp.mongodb.com/contexts) that captures all benchmarks in your project. Feel free to refer to the [Go Driver context](https://performance-monitoring-and-analysis.server-tig.prod.corp.mongodb.com/context/name/GoDriver%20perf%20task) as a template. Then, add the context to the `projectToPerfContext` map in `./cmd/perfcomp/compare.go`.

```bash
perfcomp is a cli that reports stat-sig results between evergreen patches with the mainline commit

Usage:
  perfcomp [command]

Available Commands:
  compare     compare evergreen patch to mainline commit
  mdreport    generates markdown output after run
