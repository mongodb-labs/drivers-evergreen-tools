# Scripts for OIDC testing

## Testing with the Decidicated Atlas Clusters

We have two dedicated Atlas clusters that are configured with OIDC, one with a single Identity Provider (Idp),
and one with multiple IdPs configured.


These include:

```
OIDC_ALTAS_USER         # Atlas admin username and password
OIDC_ATLAS_PASSWORD
OIDC_ATLAS_URI_MULTI    # URI for the cluster with multiple IdPs configured
OIDC_ATLAS_URI_SINGLE   # URI for the cluster with single IdP configured
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET      # The client secret used by the IdPs
OIDC_RSA_KEY            # The RSA key used by the IdPs
OIDC_JWKS_URI           # The JWKS URI used by the IdPs
OIDC_ISSUER_1_URI       # The issuer URI for mock IdP 1
OIDC_ISSUER_2_URI       # The issuer URI for mock IdP 2
```

### Prerequisites

The `oidc_get_tokens.sh` script will automatically fetch the credentials from the `drivers/oidc` vault.
See [Secrets Handling](../secrets_handling/README.md) for details on how the script accesses the vault.
Add `secrets-export.sh` to your `.gitignore` to prevent checking in credentials in your repo.

### Usage

Use the `oidc_get_tokens.sh` script to create a set of OIDC tokens in a temporary directory, including
`test_user1` and `test_user1_expires`.  The temp file location is exported as `OIDC_TOKEN_DIR`.

```bash
source ./oidc_get_tokens.sh
AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE="$OIDC_TOKEN_DIR/test_user1" /my/test/command
```

## Local Server Testing

`MONGODB-OIDC` is only supported on Linux, but we support running locally in
a Docker container.

`Dockerfile`, `docker_entry.sh`, and `start_local_server.sh` are used to launch a
local docker container running `mongo-orchestration` with OIDC enabled.

To run locally, `docker` and `python` must be installed locally (both can be
installed using brew).

Running `./start_local_server.sh` will use docker to launch the server
with the correct configuration, and expose the server on local ports 27017
and 27018.

## Evergreen Testing With Local Server - Linux Only

On Evergreen, use `ec2.assume_role` to assume the Drivers Secrets role
and set the three AWS variables accordingly.

```bash
. ./activate-authoidcvenv.sh
python oidc_write_orchestration.py
source ./oidc_get_tokens.sh
```

This will create the tokens in `OIDC_TOKEN_DIR` and
create the file `$DRIVERS_TOOLS/orchestration/configs/servers/auth-oidc.json`.

You can then run mongo orchestration with `TOPOLOGY=replicaset` and `ORCHESTRATION_FILE=auth-oidc.json`.

To set up the server auth roles, run `mongosh setup_oidc.js`.

Then, tests can be run against the server.  Set `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` to either `$OIDC_TOKEN_DIR/test_user1` or `$OIDC_TOKEN_DIR/test_user2` as desired.

The token in `$OIDC_TOKEN_DIR/test_user1_expires` can be used to test expired credentials.
