# Drivers Evergreen Tools Dockerfile

The ``Dockerfile`` and scripts in the subdirector(ies) serve dual purposes.

- Run a local server in docker container.
- Extend and run a driver test in a docker container.

You will need Docker (or podman aliased to Docker) installed and running
locally.

# Run Local Server

To run a local server, change to this directory and run:

```bash
bash ./run-local.sh
```

This will build the docker image and run it with appropriate settings.
Note that any of the environment variables used by `run-orchestration`
will be passed through to the container.
The appropriate port(s) will be exposed, allowing you to run local test against
the running docker container.

The default image can be overridden with `IMAGE``, and the entrypoint with `ENTRYPOINT`.
To use a specific architecture, use `PLATFORM`, e.g. `--platform linux/amd64`.

## Driver Testing in Docker

To extend this image and run against a driver test suite, first build the
image locally.

```bash
docker build -t drivers-evergreen-tools .
```

Then, in your `Dockerfile`, use `FROM drivers-evergreen-tools`.

When running your derived image, use `-v $DRIVERS_TOOLS:/root/drivers-evergreen-tools`
to use the local checkout.

In your entry point script, run `run-orchestration.sh` before running your test suite.
Note that you will probably want to expose the environment variables as is done in `run-local.sh`.
